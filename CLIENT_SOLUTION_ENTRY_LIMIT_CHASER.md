# ✅ CLIENT REQUEST RESOLVED: Entry Limit Chaser Implementation

## 🎯 **Client's Question Answered**

> *"I seen the video, but I think we still not resolved the issue of how can i enter with a limit chaser, in the entry position section?"*

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

We have **successfully implemented Entry Limit Chaser functionality** that allows you to use limit chasing **for the entry position itself**, not just for exits!

## 🚀 **What's New**

### **1. Entry Limit Chaser Feature Added**
- ✅ **New UI Section**: "Entry Limit Chaser" with dedicated controls
- ✅ **Smart Entry Execution**: Automatically chases better entry prices
- ✅ **Configurable Parameters**: Distance, max chases, update intervals
- ✅ **IOC Behavior**: Fill-or-Cancel orders for immediate execution

### **2. Enhanced Basket Order Types**
```typescript
// NEW: Entry order now supports limit chasing
entryOrder: {
  type: 'limit',
  quantity: 0.001,
  price: 95000,
  leverage: 10,
  
  // NEW: Entry limit chaser configuration
  limitChaser: {
    enabled: true,
    distance: 0.005,        // 0.5% distance from market
    distanceType: 'percentage',
    fillOrCancel: true,     // IOC orders
    updateInterval: 30,     // Update every 30 seconds
    maxChases: 5,           // Maximum 5 attempts
    chaseCount: 0
  }
}
```

### **3. New Basket Status: `entry_chasing`**
- Tracks when the system is actively chasing entry prices
- Clear distinction between hunting for entry vs. managing position

## 🎮 **How to Use**

### **Step 1: Create Basket Order**
1. Set Order Type to **"Limit"**
2. Enter your target entry price
3. **Enable "Entry Limit Chaser"** checkbox ✅

### **Step 2: Configure Entry Chaser**
```
Distance: 0.5% (chases 0.5% better than market)
Max Chases: 5 (tries up to 5 times)
Update Interval: 30 seconds
☑ Fill or Cancel (IOC behavior)
```

### **Step 3: Execute & Monitor**
- System automatically places and updates entry orders
- Chases better prices until filled or max attempts reached
- Once filled, proceeds to stop loss and exit strategies

## 📊 **Real Example**

### **BTC Long with Entry Chaser**
```
Market Price: $95,000
Your Target: Enter below $95,000

Entry Chaser Action:
1. Places limit buy at $94,525 (0.5% below market)
2. Market rises to $95,500 → Updates to $95,027
3. Market drops to $94,800 → Updates to $94,326
4. Order fills at $94,326 → Entry successful!
5. Activates stop loss and exit strategies
```

**Result**: You got a **better entry price** ($94,326 vs $95,000) automatically! 🎯
