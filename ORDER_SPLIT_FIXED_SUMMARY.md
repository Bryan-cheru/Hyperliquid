# ðŸ”„ ORDER SPLIT FUNCTIONALITY - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Leverage vs Split Count Confusion**
- **Before**: Split count was incorrectly using the leverage slider (0-30)
- **After**: Separate `splitCount` state (2-10 orders) independent from leverage
- **Impact**: Clear separation between position leverage and order splitting

### 2. **Forced Disabled Order Split**
- **Before**: ButtonWrapper forced `orderSplit: false` and `splitCount: 1`
- **After**: Respects user's order split settings from UI
- **Impact**: Order splitting now actually works when enabled

### 3. **Missing Test Coverage**
- **Before**: No automated testing for order split functionality
- **After**: Comprehensive test coverage including price range setting and split count
- **Impact**: Reliable automated validation of order split features

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Implementation

### UI Controls Working
âœ… Order Split Toggle (`data-testid="order-split-toggle"`)
âœ… Min/Max Price Inputs for order distribution range
âœ… Split Count Slider (2-10 orders) 
âœ… Scale Type Selection (Lower/Mid point/Upper)
âœ… Integration with Position Size (1%-100%)

### Backend Processing Working  
âœ… TradingParams properly pass order split settings
âœ… ButtonWrapper respects orderSplit, minPrice, maxPrice, splitCount
âœ… Conditional orders (basket orders) inherit split settings
âœ… Dynamic quantity calculation with order splitting

### Test Coverage Working
âœ… Position size setting (10% default)
âœ… Order split toggle activation
âœ… Split count configuration 
âœ… Price range setting (108k-112k)
âœ… Integration with basket orders and LONG/SHORT buttons

## ðŸ“Š Example Usage

### Standard Order Split
```
Position Size: 20%
Split Count: 3 orders
Price Range: $108,000 - $112,000
Result: 3 orders of 0.0667 BTC each across price range
```

### Combined with Basket Orders
```
Basket Orders: âœ… Enabled (stop loss + take profit)
Order Split: âœ… Enabled (3 orders)
Result: 3 main orders + 3 stop loss orders + 3 take profit orders
```

## ðŸ”§ Key Files Updated

1. **Market.tsx**
   - Added `splitCount` state separate from leverage
   - Fixed slider labels and ranges
   - Added test ID for automation

2. **ButtonWrapper.tsx**
   - Removed forced order split disabling
   - Now respects all split parameters from UI
   - Conditional orders inherit split settings

3. **test-1.spec.ts**
   - Added order split testing section
   - Split count configuration
   - Price range setting validation

## ðŸš€ Ready for Production

The order split functionality is now fully implemented and integrated with:
- âœ… Dynamic position sizing
- âœ… Basket order conditional trades
- âœ… HyperLiquid API compatibility
- âœ… Comprehensive test coverage
- âœ… User-friendly UI controls

Users can now effectively implement DCA (dollar-cost averaging) strategies by splitting their orders across custom price ranges with 2-10 individual orders per trade.
