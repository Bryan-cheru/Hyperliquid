# Hyperliquid Order Type Implementation - Status Report

## Current Implementation Summary

The Hyperliquid trading UI now correctly distinguishes between Market and Limit orders in the user interface, with the following key components working properly:

### ‚úÖ What's Working Correctly

1. **UI Order Type Distinction**: 
   - Market and Limit order components pass correct `orderType` parameter
   - UI trading history shows "Market" vs "Limit" based on local tracking and inference logic
   - Order placement correctly sets appropriate parameters for each order type

2. **Local Order Type Registry**:
   - `orderTypeRegistry` in TradingContext tracks orders placed through the UI
   - Overrides API-inferred types with locally known types for better accuracy
   - Handles multiple order ID formats (oid, tid, resting orders)

3. **Order Type Inference Logic**:
   - Uses IoC (Immediate or Cancel) timing to identify market orders
   - Considers order direction, liquidation status, and fill characteristics
   - Provides fallback logic when registry data is unavailable

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Expected Behavior Limitation

**Important**: Orders placed as "Market" in the UI will **always** appear as "Limit" orders in Hyperliquid's backend/explorer. This is by design due to how Hyperliquid implements market orders internally.

#### Technical Explanation

Hyperliquid does not have true "market orders" in the traditional sense. Instead:

1. **Market Orders are IoC Limit Orders**: When you place a market order, Hyperliquid internally converts it to a limit order with:
   - IoC (Immediate or Cancel) timing
   - Price set to a value that ensures immediate execution
   - Aggressive pricing to match against existing orders

2. **Backend Classification**: Hyperliquid's backend API and explorer classify all orders as "Limit" orders since they technically are limit orders with special parameters.

3. **UI Enhancement**: Our UI layer adds intelligence to distinguish these IoC limit orders as "Market" orders for better user experience.

### üìä Current Order Flow

```
User selects "Market Order" in UI
         ‚Üì
UI sends IoC limit order to Hyperliquid
         ‚Üì
Hyperliquid processes as limit order with IoC timing
         ‚Üì
Backend/Explorer shows as "Limit" order
         ‚Üì
Our UI infers it back to "Market" for display
```

### üîß Implementation Details

#### Order Type Registry
```typescript
// Tracks locally placed orders with their intended types
const [orderTypeRegistry, setOrderTypeRegistry] = useState<Map<string, 'market' | 'limit'>>(new Map());

// Registration happens during order placement
setOrderTypeRegistry(prev => {
  const newRegistry = new Map(prev);
  newRegistry.set(orderId, order.orderType);
  return newRegistry;
});
```

#### Order Type Inference
```typescript
// Multi-factor inference for historical orders
let orderType: 'market' | 'limit' = 'limit';

if (fill.tif === 'Ioc' || fill.tif === 'IOC') {
  orderType = 'market';
} else if (fill.dir === 'Close' || fill.liquidation) {
  orderType = 'market';
} else if (fill.startPosition === fill.sz) {
  orderType = 'market';
}
```

#### Registry Override in Trade History
```typescript
// Check local registry first, then fall back to inference
const localOrderType = orderTypeRegistry.get(trade.orderId);
if (localOrderType) {
  trade.type = localOrderType;
  console.log('‚úÖ Used registered order type:', localOrderType);
} else {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è No registered type, using inferred:', trade.type);
}
```

### üéØ User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear UI Labeling**: The UI clearly shows "Market" vs "Limit" in trading history
2. **Consistent Order Placement**: Order buttons correctly set parameters for each type
3. **Intelligent Inference**: Historical orders are classified using multiple factors
4. **Local Override**: Recently placed orders use accurate local tracking

### üîÆ Future Considerations

1. **User Education**: Consider adding tooltip/info explaining why Hyperliquid explorer shows all orders as "Limit"
2. **Extended Registry**: Could persist order type registry to localStorage for longer-term accuracy
3. **Enhanced Inference**: Could add more sophisticated pattern matching for order type detection
4. **API Monitoring**: Monitor for Hyperliquid API changes that might affect order classification

### üìù Conclusion

The implementation successfully provides the best possible order type distinction within the constraints of Hyperliquid's architecture. While the UI correctly shows Market vs Limit orders, users should understand that Hyperliquid's backend will always classify them as Limit orders due to the IoC implementation pattern.

This is not a bug or limitation of our implementation, but rather the expected behavior when working with Hyperliquid's market order system.
