## üîß Issues We Fixed During Our Conversation

### **Problem 1: Prices Weren't Updating** ‚úÖ **FIXED**
Your app was showing Bitcoin at $97,000 when the real price was different. We simplified the price system and now you see live, accurate prices that update every few seconds.

### **Problem 2: Basket Orders Were Completely Hidden** ‚úÖ **FIXED** 
The Basket Orders feature had a technical bug where you literally couldn't see it! We discovered and fixed the hidden component issue, so now it's always visible.

### **Problem 3: Feature Was Too Hard to Find** ‚úÖ **IMPROVED**
After you still couldn't find it, we made it more prominent with better styling and clearer labeling, while keeping it professional and space-efficient.

**Result**: Everything is now working properly and clearly visible!

## üéØ How to Use Your Trading App

### Step 1: Connect Your Account
1. Open the app and click "Connect Account"
2. Enter your HyperLiquid public key (this is safe - no private keys needed!)
3. The app will automatically detect your account type

*Note: Your public key is like your account number - it's safe to share and lets you view your trading data.*

### Step 2: Find the Basket Orders Feature
**Here's exactly where to find it:**

1. **Look at the RIGHT side of your screen** - there's a trading panel on the right
2. **In the trading panel, look for two buttons at the top**: "Market" and "Limit"
3. **Make sure one of them is selected** (they'll be highlighted in yellow)
4. **Scroll down in that trading panel** until you see checkboxes
5. **Look for the checkbox labeled "Basket Orders"** - it looks like this: ‚òëÔ∏è **Basket Orders**
6. **Click the checkbox** to enable basket orders
7. **The basket order panel will appear below** with two tabs:
   - **"Create Basket"** - to make new basket orders
   - **"Manage Baskets"** - to see your existing orders

**Important**: The Basket Orders checkbox is in the **right-side trading panel**, not in the main center area or left tabs!

### Step 3: Create Your First Basket Order
Once you've checked the Basket Orders box:

1. **Fill in the form that appears:**
   - **Basket Name**: Give it a name like "My BTC Strategy"
   - **Symbol**: Choose your cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, SOL)
   - **Side**: Choose "Long" (buy) or "Short" (sell)
   - **Quantity**: How much you want to trade
   - **Entry Price**: The app will auto-fill this with current market price

   - **Stop Loss**: Check the box and set a price to sell if you're losing money
   - **Smart Tracking**: Check the box to automatically move your orders for better prices

3. **Click "Create & Execute Basket Order"**

### Step 4: Monitor Your Basket Orders

- **Cancel orders** if needed with the red "Cancel" button

## ÔøΩ Key Features That Make Your App Special

### 1. Basket Orders (Your Main Tool)
Think of this like buying a basket of groceries, but for cryptocurrency. Instead of buying Bitcoin, then Ethereum, then Solana separately, you can buy them all at once with one click.

**Why this is valuable:**
- Saves you time (no need to place multiple orders)
- Gets you better prices (the app finds the best deals)
- Reduces your risk (automatically spreads your money across multiple coins)

### 2. Smart Order Tracking
Your app watches the market constantly and moves your orders to better prices automatically.

**Real example:** 
- You want to buy Bitcoin at $67,000
- The market moves and someone offers it at $66,950
- Your app automatically cancels your old order and places a new one at the better price
- You save $50 per Bitcoin!

### 3. Account Management Made Simple
You can connect to your HyperLiquid account safely using only your public key. This means:
- ‚úÖ You can see all your trading data
- ‚úÖ No risk of someone stealing your money
- ‚úÖ Works with both personal and managed accounts

## ÔøΩÔ∏è Safety Features Built In

### Automatic Stop Losses
If your investment loses money, the app can automatically sell to prevent bigger losses.

**Example:** You invest $10,000 and set a 5% stop loss. If your investments drop to $9,500, the app automatically sells everything to protect you from losing more.

### Risk Management
- The app shows you exactly how much you could lose
- Warns you if you're taking too much risk
- Splits large orders to get better prices

## üö® What to Watch For

### Good Signs (Everything is Working)
- You see messages like "üî• BTC Price: $67,423" (this means live prices are working)
- Your orders appear in the "Open Orders" section
- Prices update every few seconds

### Warning Signs (Something Might Be Wrong)
- Prices stay the same for a long time
- You see error messages
- Orders don't appear after placing them

**If you see problems:** Check your internet connection and try refreshing the page.

## üéØ Your Next Steps

### 1. Test the Price Fix

### 2. Find Your Basket Orders Feature

**Look for this in the right-side trading panel:**

- **Clean checkbox** that's easy to spot

- **Compact design** that doesn't interfere with other controls

**Exact location steps:**
1. **Look at the RIGHT side of your screen** (trading controls panel)
2. **Find the trading panel** with "Market" and "Limit" buttons
3. **Scroll down** until you see **üß∫ Basket Orders** in a subtle gray box

**If you still can't find it:**

- **Look for the small üß∫ basket emoji** in the right panel

- **Make sure you're scrolled down** in the right trading panel (not the center charts area)

**Note from our conversation**: We've made several improvements to ensure this feature is visible while keeping the interface clean and professional. The basket emoji (üß∫) should make it easy to spot!

## üí¨ About Our Troubleshooting Process
